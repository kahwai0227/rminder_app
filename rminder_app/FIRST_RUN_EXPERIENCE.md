# First-Run Experience Documentation

## Overview
The RMinder app now includes a comprehensive first-run experience designed to help new users get started quickly and understand the app's features.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Onboarding Screen
- **When shown**: Automatically displayed on the first app launch
- **Purpose**: Introduces the app's core features and benefits
- **Design**: Clean, modern interface matching the app's deepPurple theme
- **Actions**: 
  - "Get Started" - Completes onboarding and enters the main app
  - "Learn More" - Opens the comprehensive tips screen

### 2. Tips Screen
- **Access**: Available from onboarding or via help buttons in all main screens
- **Content**: Step-by-step guides for each app feature:
  - Setting up budgets
  - Tracking expenses
  - Managing savings goals
  - Handling debt/liabilities
  - Using reports
  - Pro tips and best practices

### 3. Help Integration
- **Location**: Help button (?) added to all main screen AppBars
- **Consistency**: Same tips screen accessible from anywhere in the app
- **Non-intrusive**: Small icon that doesn't clutter the interface

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses `shared_preferences` to persist onboarding completion state
- `AppState` provider manages the onboarding status
- Clean separation between first-run logic and main app functionality

### Navigation Flow
```
App Launch → AppInitializer → Check onboarding status
                          ↓
              First run: OnboardingScreen → MainScreen
                          ↓
              Returning user: MainScreen directly
```
